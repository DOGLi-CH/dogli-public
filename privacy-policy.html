<p><strong>DOGLi Privacy Policy</strong></p>
<p>DOGLi GmbH is committed to protecting and respecting your privacy in
connection with your use of our mobile application(s), the website(s)
and other online presences, such as our social media profiles
(hereinafter collectively referred to as "Offer"). This Privacy Policy
and any other documents referred to herein set forth the basis on which
any of your personal data we collect, or that you provide to us in
connection with the Offer will be processed by us, for what purposes and
to what extent.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>DATA WE MAY COLLECT</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Among the types of Personal Data that this Application collects, by
itself or through third parties, there are for example, your name,
e-mail address, password, information you provide when you create your
profile and/or complete your dog’s profile, and any other personal
information that you choose to send to us.</p>
<p>Data about your usage of the Offer, about your device and about your
visits to and use of this Offer (including your IP address, geographical
location, operating system, browser type and version, referral source,
length of visit and navigation paths).</p>
<p>Data such as photos and videos that you upload to our Offer, for
which you are the content owner, for which you have the consent of all
parties who appear in it, and that you elect to share within our Offer
with the understanding that this data will be publicly visible to any
user of the application. By uploading content to our Offer you transfer
the right to share the data to us.</p>
<p>Data collected by tracking technologies that may identify you as an
individual or allow online contact with you as an individual.</p>
<p>Social media profile information, such as name, email address, and
social media ID, if you choose to log in to the Offer through social
media.</p>
<p>As part of our referral system, we will ask you for name and email
address of people you would like to refer to us. We will use this data
to invite the referral to join our Offer. We store this data for the
sole purpose of sending invitations, tracking the success of our
referral program and crediting you with the referral bonus, if any.
Before you disclose to us the personal information of another person,
you must obtain that person’s consent to both the disclosure and the
processing of that personal information in accordance with this
policy.</p>
<ol start="2" type="1">
<li><p>USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To provide you with the Offer and personalize our Offer for you.</p>
<p>To answer your questions or requests for information and to handle
your complaints.</p>
<p>To manage your payments and orders.</p>
<p>To provide you with marketing communications, such as email or
newsletters, to the extent that you have provided consent.</p>
<p>To understand your broad, non-specific geographic location (e.g.
country) to help us identify groups of users.</p>
<p>To identify your default language settings and other device
information to provide our Offer in the most accurate way.</p>
<p>To keep our Offer secure and prevent fraud.</p>
<p>To notify you about updates or changes to our Offer, the Terms of Use
and the Privacy Policy.</p>
<ol start="3" type="1">
<li><p>CONFIDENTIALITY AND SECURITY</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The security of your personal data is important to us. We follow
generally accepted standards to protect the personal data submitted to
us, both during transmission and once it is received. We maintain
technical, administrative and physical safeguards to help protect the
security of your personal data against unauthorized access, destruction,
loss, alteration, misuse or disclosure.</p>
<p>The data processing is carried out using computers and/or IT enabled
tools, following organizational procedures and modes strictly related to
the purposes indicated. In some cases, the data may be accessible to
certain types of persons in charge, involved with the operation of this
application (administration, sales, marketing, legal, system
administration) or external parties (such as third-party technical
service providers, mail carriers, hosting providers, IT companies,
communications agencies) appointed, if necessary, as data
processors.</p>
<p>We will not, without your express consent, supply your personal
information to any third party for the purpose of their or any other
third party’s marketing efforts.</p>
<p>We may include hyperlinks in our application, website(s) and social
media. For such hyperlinks to, and details of, third-party applications
and websites, we have no control over and are not responsible for, the
privacy policies and practices of third parties.</p>
<ol start="4" type="1">
<li><p>STORING OF YOUR DATA</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We will store all data you provide on our secure (password- and
firewall-protected) servers using Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) in the US
(to be checked). Any payment transactions will be encrypted using SSL
technology. You can recognize such encrypted connections by the prefix
https:// in the address bar of your browser. All payment data is stored
with our payment processor and is never stored on DOGLi’s servers.</p>
<p>Where we have given you (or where you have chosen) a password which
enables you to access certain parts of the Offer, you are responsible
for keeping this password confidential; we will not ask you for your
password (except when you log in to our application). We ask you not to
share a password with anyone, and suggest that your change your password
frequently.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the transmission of data via the Internet is never
completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
data, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to the
Offer; any transmission is at your own risk. Once we have received your
data, we will use strict procedures and security features to try to
prevent unauthorized access.</p>
<ol start="5" type="1">
<li><p>TRACKING AND COOKIES USE</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Tracker indicates any technology - e.g cookies, unique identifiers,
web beacons, embedded scripts, e-tags and fingerprinting - that enables
the tracking of users, for example by accessing or storing information
on the user’s device. Any use of cookies and other tracking tools by
this Offer or by any third-party services used by this Offer serves the
purpose of providing the Offer required by the user.</p>
<p>Cookies are text files that contain data from visited websites or
domains and are stored by a browser on the user's computer. A cookie is
primarily used to store information about a user during or after his
visit within an online offer. Stored information may include, for
example, language settings on a website, login status, a shopping cart,
or where a video was watched. The term cookies also includes other
technologies that perform the same functions as cookies.</p>
<p>The legal basis on which we process your personal data using cookies
depends on whether we ask you for consent. If this is the case and you
consent to the use of cookies, the legal basis for the processing of
your data is the declared consent. Otherwise, the data processed with
the help of cookies is processed on the basis of our legitimate
interests (e.g. in a business operation of our online offer and its
improvement) or, if the use of cookies is necessary to fulfill our
contractual obligations.</p>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li><p>THIRD PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>This Offer uses services, platforms and software from other providers
(hereinafter referred to as "third-party providers") for the purposes of
organizing, managing, planning and providing our Offer. In this context,
personal data may be processed and stored on the servers of the
third-party providers. This may involve various data that we process in
accordance with this privacy policy. This data may include, in
particular, master data and contact data of users, data on transactions,
contracts, other processes and their contents.</p>
<p>If users are referred to third-party providers or their software or
platforms in the course of communication, business or other
relationships with us, the third-party providers may process usage data
and metadata for security purposes, service optimization or marketing
purposes. We therefore ask you to observe the data protection notices of
the respective third-party providers.</p>

<ol start="7" type="1">
<li><p>LEGAL BASES OF PERSONAL DATA PROCESSING</p></li>
</ol>
<p>In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) of
the European Union, specifically its Article 6 legal bases for personal
data processing, DOGLi’s legitimate interest is based on the performance
of the contract (the DOGLi Terms of Use) between users and DOGLi for the
data processing relating to the user’s use of DOGLi’s Offer (including
orders and payments).</p>
<p>We may process personal data if users have given their consent for
one or more specific purposes, such as for the performance of Offer, to
comply with a legal obligation or contract, to pursue the legitimate
interests of the Offer or a third party, and to exercise a task that is
carried out in the public interest vested to the Offer by an official
authority.</p>
<p>Personal information that we process for any purpose will not be kept
for longer than is necessary for that purpose. Personal data collected
for purposes related to the performance of the Offer shall be retained
until the Offer has been fully performed. Personal Data collected for
the purposes of the Offer’s legitimate interests shall be retained as
long as needed to fulfill such purposes. The Owner may be allowed to
retain Personal Data for a longer period whenever the User has given
consent to such processing, as long as such consent is not withdrawn
(“opt-out”).</p>
<ol start="8" type="1">
<li><p>DATA TRANSMISSION TO OTHER COUNTRIES</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Depending on the user's location, data transfers may involve
transferring the user's data to a country other than their own. Users
are entitled to learn about the legal basis of data transfers to a
country other than their own or to any international organization
governed by public international law or set up by two or more countries,
such as the UN, and about the security measures taken by DOGLi to
safeguard their data.</p>
<p>We may disclose your personal data to service providers or other
third parties domiciled abroad, and in particular outside the European
Union, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom. We are committed to the
EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and the Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield (<a
href="https://www.privacyshield.gov/">https://www.privacyshield.gov/</a>).
However, we are not relying exclusively on these frameworks and are
working to implement other transfer mechanisms such as Standard
Contractual Clauses to address any transfers of personal data to the
U.S., consistent with applicable law.</p>
<ol start="9" type="1">
<li><p>YOUR DATA RIGHTS</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The GDPR gives certain rights to applicable individuals in relation
to their personal data. Accordingly, we have implemented transparency
and access controls to help such users, including residents of the EU,
Switzerland, and the United Kingdom exercise those rights. As required
under applicable law, the rights afforded to you are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A right of access: you have the right to obtain (i) confirmation
as to whether personal data concerning you are processed or not and, if
processed, to obtain (ii) access to such data and a copy
thereof.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to rectification: you have the right to obtain the
rectification of any inaccurate personal data concerning you. You also
have the right to have incomplete personal data completed, including by
means of providing a supplementary statement.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to erasure: in some cases, you have the right to obtain
the erasure of personal data concerning you. Upon request, DOGLi will
permanently and irrevocably anonymize your data such that it can never
be reconstructed to identify you as an individual. However, this is not
an absolute right and DOGLi may have legal or legitimate grounds for
keeping such data.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to restriction of processing: in some cases, you have the
right to obtain restriction of the processing of your personal
data.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to data portability: you have the right to receive the
personal data concerning you which you have provided to DOGLi, in a
structured, commonly used and machine-readable format, and you have the
right to transmit those data to another controller without hindrance
from DOGLi. This right only applies when the processing of your personal
data is based on your consent or on a contract and such processing is
carried out by automated means.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to object to processing: you have the right to object at
any time, on grounds relating to your particular situation, to
processing of personal data concerning you when such processing is based
on the legitimate interest of DOGLi. DOGLi may, however, invoke
compelling legitimate grounds for continued processing. When your
personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the
right to object at any time to the processing of such data. You may, in
particular, exercise that right by clicking on the “unsubscribe” link
provided at the bottom of any messages received, or by managing your
privacy preferences by logging in to your DOGLi account and following
the instructions here.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to lodge a complaint with the competent supervisory
authority: you have the right to contact the supervisory authority to
complain about DOGLi’s personal data protection practices.</p></li>
<li><p>A right to give instructions concerning the use of your data
after your death: as required by applicable law, you may have the right
to give DOGLi instructions concerning the use of your personal data
after your death.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To exercise one or more of these rights, you can email <a
href="mailto:Info@DOGLi.app">Info@DOGLi.app</a>. You may access your
personal data to modify or update at any time via an online account, or
by emailing <a href="mailto:Info@DOGLi.app">Info@DOGLi.app</a>. We will
respond to your request in a reasonable timeframe in accordance with
applicable law.</p>
